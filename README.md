Hi! These are my machine learning projects. I really enjoyed building models to understand a range of areas—including real estate, sports analytics, finance, and beverages.

### What the HTML file contains
The HTML file is a rendered, easy-to-read report version of a project (typically exported from a notebook/reporting tool). In general, it includes:
A clear project write-up with headings and narrative explanations (problem, approach, and takeaways)
Visuals and tables (EDA summaries, plots, model comparisons, etc.)
A structured breakdown of the modeling process (features, methods, evaluation strategy)
Results + interpretation (metrics, what worked best, and why it matters)
A “final story” that’s meant to be readable without digging into raw code 
housing

### What the .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) contains
The .ipynb file is the working notebook behind the project—basically the “build version” of what you see in the HTML. In general, it includes:
Code cells that load data, clean it, and engineer features
Step-by-step model training workflows (pipelines, tuning, experimentation)
Evaluation code (metrics, validation, plots)
Notes/comments alongside code to document decisions
The reproducible process used to generate the final outputs shown in the HTML
