    "Major League Baseball (MLB) is exploring ways to use technology and data science to enhance the fan experience during live broadcasts. One such initiative is the automatic identification of pitch types in real time, which would allow pitch information to appear instantly on-screen and in stadiums.\n",
    "The purpose of this report is to develop a proof-of-concept model that predicts the type of pitch thrown by Kevin Gausman using Statcast data. The goal is to determine whether machine learning can accurately classify pitch types based on measurable characteristics such as release speed, spin rate, and movement, supporting MLB’s efforts to deliver faster, data-driven insights during games. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier was trained to predict pitch type and evaluated using accuracy on test data. This model serves as a foundation for MLB’s broader goal of implementing real-time pitch classification across all pitchers to improve broadcast operations and fan engagement."

    "To develop a real-time pitch-type prediction model, historical Statcast data from Kevin Gausman’s 2024 season was used for training and 2025 data for testing. Key features such as  pitch velocity, spin rate, horizontal and vertical movement, and batter stance were used. The data was cleaned and preprocessed using scikit-learn pipelines with imputation, scaling, and one-hot encoding. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier was selected for its simplicity and speed in real-time settings. The model was trained on 2024 data and evaluated on 2025 data to assess accuracy and generalizability for live broadcast use."

Based on these results, the model could be used in practice for tasks regarding identification of  pitch types in real time or supporting post-game analysis. It models how measurable features such as speed, spin rate, and movement correspond to different pitch types with strong accuracy.\n",

    "Even with these strong results, there are limits to this model. The data were not evenly distributed across pitch types, with most examples being fastballs and split-fingers. Hence, the model may not predict rare pitches such as sliders or sinkers as accurately. Because KNN relies on distance metrics, it can also become slower and less practical with larger or streaming datasets. These issues should be ntoed and accounted for prior to utilizing this model in a live setting.\n",

    "If the model were not used, the main concern avoided would be depending on predictions that may not hold up for different pitchers or future seasons. Pitchers vary in release angles, velocity profiles, and spin patterns, so a model trained on one individual might not generalize to others. To make this system more reliable, future work should include collecting more balanced data, testing additional algorithms such as Random Forests, and adding contextual variables like game situation or batter tendencies.\n",
